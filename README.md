# Competitions

## Objective

This repository containls all muy work for all competitions in which I have participartedin Kaggle and Zindi.Africa.

## Competition 1: Natural Processing Language

This project will use a set of movies genres data . Each observation has the titile of the movie, year of the movie, title plot and the different genres of the movie (a movie might be classified to multiples genres).

Title: 'How to Be a Serial Killer'</br>
Plot: 'A serial killer decides to teach the secrets of his satisfying career to a video store clerk.'</br>
Genres: 'Comedy', 'Crime', 'Horror'

The idea is to use this data in order to predict the likely of a movie belongs to a genre given its plot.

Thank to Professor Fabio Gonz√°lez, Ph.D. y his student John Arevalo by providing  this dataser. See <https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01992>

In this project, the full Machine Learning pipeline can be seen in each part of this work:

- Exploratory  Data Analysis
- Data Cleansing in order to remove noisy
- Text Preprocessing in order to reduce the corpus of the vocabulary.
- Text tokenization/vectorization
- Modeling  
- Model Hyperparameter tuning
- Prediction
- Model Deployment to production  

## Exploratory  Data Analysis
